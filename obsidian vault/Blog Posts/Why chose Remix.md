Remix is a meta framework built on top react that gives you the ability to make full stack react apps, enable SSR, deploy on any NodeJS runtime or platform, a lot of api's that make development easier with a lot of opinion on how to build react apps. So why choose Remix since you are already building react apps so here are list of reasons why I would pick Remix your opinion may differ but follow along to see if you would like to build using Remix.

### Loaders

Loaders are way of fetching data at the route level. This helps to reduce client waterfalls because the route fetches all the data you need for a particular route therefore reducing server roundtrips that may occur when data is fetched on a component level during rendering.

### Optimistic updates
Remix helps us to perform optimistic UI updates which by the way almost no meta framework or framework does. Remix exposes the useFetcher api that does form submission without navigation which has the ability to get the data you are trying to send in the form which gives you the ability to do optimistic updates, you could check this on the Remix docs and this is the link to the useFetcher api in the docs.
note: add the link to the docs on useFetcher.


### Route prefetching

In Remix when a user hovers on a link the data for the route is fetched in the background.
This feature make the data for the next page even before the page is even navigated to which makes navigation to the next page faster, other meta framework like Nextjs, Sveltekit,  Solid Start and Nuxt but most of them except from Solid Start prefetch when the link is in the viewport but this means that if the link is never used fetching the data for the next page is a wasted but because Remix does this on hover there is a more probability that the user clicks on the link.


### Loading indicator on Navigation

I have used a lot of sites that either does SSR, traditional SPAs and even RSC when you are navigating to a new page there is no form of loading indicator that shows that navigation is occurring but Remix gives us the ability to check if navigation is occuring using the useNavigation api which exposes a navigation page, this is the link **Link provided here** to the docs on useNavigation.


### Deployment

Remix gives us the ability to deploy our apps on any platform like vercel and Netlify, on any NodeJS runtime like cloudflare workers, etc. This is made possible through adapters created by the Remix community and The Remix core team, speaking about adapters let's move to next point.


### Adapters

Remix gives us the ability to create adapters that could be created by the Remix core team or any community members which helps us to give access to features that are not neccesarilly part of Remix but that means the Remix core team are always depended for new features and also gives room for innovation.


So those are the reasons why I would choose Remix if you have any opinion on this topic feel free to make a comment on the post so you can elaborate on why you would use Remix or not. 


Peace nerds!
