Variables
Variables are a construct in programming that is used to store values that are used later in a program. In rust variables are immutable which means that when the variable is declared 


Const
If we come from other programming languages we are familiar with const keyword  which is used on variables that we don't want to be able modify, since in rust variables are immutable
