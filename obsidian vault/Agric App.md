4. If users signs up as normal user sees sections for different goods such as livestock, vegetables, Rice, etc and those sections contains farmers in the normal user's location according to the good they sell.
5. Normal users have the ability to chat with farmers and discuss the price they want to buy the goods of the farmers.
6. if users signs up as a farmer a getting started guide, the getting started guide guides the farmer on how the interface works and features that are inside the app.
7. Farmers have the ability to chat with buyers, once the normal user and farmer decide on a price the farmers connect with drivers to deliver the goods. Once the buy is ready a certain percent would be collected by us.
8. Farmers have the ability to get insights using the AI our app provides but the insights would  be behind a pay wall.
9. Farmers have the ability to rent or buy farming equipment's.
10. if the user signs up as a driver they then have to validate that their registered drivers, the requirements to be validated as a validated driver are plate number, car info, drivers licence etc.
