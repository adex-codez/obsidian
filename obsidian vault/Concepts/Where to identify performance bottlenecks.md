 * Hardware 
 Performance bottlenecks could be found in CPU, Memory, Disk IO. The server that we use may not have the hardware resources that would sufficient to deal with high load.
 
-  Server settings
 The app server, database server, web server could be bottlenecks if they are not configured well to use the available resources properly.
 
- Database 
 The database could be a bottleneck because the query to the database maybe not be optimized, there is no proper indexes to make database queries faster.
 
- Code
The code that we write may also be able bottleneck. There may be lines of codes, blocks of code, functions, classes that may cause memory leak, fast execution.

- Load balancers
if the load is not getting distributed properly between server nodes it could cause performance bottlenecks so if the load is distributed properly using load balancers there could be increase in performance.

- Network
