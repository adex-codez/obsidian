**Raised Elements**
The top of the element should have box shadow inset with a slight vertical offset eg. 
box-shadow: inset 0, 1px 0 hsl(224, 84%, 74%).
The colour you use for the box shadow should be hand picked instead how using a semi transparent white or just overlaying with white which would suck the saturation of the underline colour.
For the bottom of the element use box shadow with a slight vertical offset, the shadow must appear below the element. eg. box-shadow: 0 1px 3px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, .2).


Inset Elements
The bottom should have a box shadow with a negative vertical offset while the top should have a box shadow inset with a vertical offset
