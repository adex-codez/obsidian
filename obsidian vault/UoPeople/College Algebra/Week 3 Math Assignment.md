Task 1
The equation for the function is h(t) = -7t<sup>2</sup> + v<sub>0</sub>t + h<sub>0</sub>, where  v<sub>0</sub> = 0m/sec and   h<sub>0</sub> = 20m.
I(a) Domain: it is all real numbers
 h = - (b/2a)
  =  - (0/ 2(7))
  = - (0/14)
  = 0

h(t) = -7(0)<sup>2</sup> + 0(0) + 20
    = -7(0) + 0 + 20
    = 0 + 0 +20
     = 20

Since a is negative the range is (-âˆž, 20]

The significance for domain is that the domain gives us the possible time the bungee jumper can leap from the river surface while the range gives us all the possible heights the bungee jumper can jump given a time.

b) h = - (b/2a)
  =  - (0/ 2(7))
  = - (0/14)
  = 0

h(t) = -7(0)<sup>2</sup> + 0(0) + 20
    = -7(0) + 0 + 20
    = 0 + 0 +20
     = 20
 The vertex is 0. The vertex is the maximum time the bungee jumper reaches the maximum height.

c)  h = - (b/2a)
  =  - (0/ 2(7))
  = - (0/14)
  = 0

h(t) = -7(0)<sup>2</sup> + 0(0) + 20
    = -7(0) + 0 + 20
    = 0 + 0 +20
     = 20
 The time the bungee jumper reaches the maximum height above the river surface after leaping from the bridge is 0 seconds while the maximum height above the river surface after the bungee jumper leaps from the bridge is 20m

d) h(t) = -7t<sup>2</sup> + v<sub>0</sub>t + h<sub>0</sub>
  h(t)  = -7t<sup>2</sup> + 0(t) + 20   
 11 = -7t<sup>2</sup> + 0 + 20
 11 = -7t<sup>2</sup> + 20
 7t<sup>2</sup> = 20 - 11
 7t<sup>2</sup> = 9
 t<sup>2</sup>  = 9 / 7
 t<sup>2</sup> = 1.29
 t = sqrt(1.29)
 t = 1.13s
The time the bungee jumper reached the height of 11m is 1.13s

e) h(t) = -7t<sup>2</sup> + v<sub>0</sub>t + h<sub>0</sub>
   h(t)  = -7t<sup>2</sup> + 0(t) + 20   
  h(20) = -7(20)<sup>2</sup> + 0(20) + 20
  -7(40) + 0 + 20
  -280 + 0 + 20
  -280 + 20
  -260
  This means that after 20 seconds of the jump the bungee jumper is already 260m inside the river.
f) t = -b sqrt(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac) / 2a
   = 0 sqrt(0 - 4(-7)(20)) / 2(-7)
   = 0 sqrt(0-(-560)) / -14
   = 0 sqrt(0+560) / -14
   = 0 sqrt(560) /-14
t = 0 - sqrt(560) / -14 or 0 + sqrt(560) /-14
t = 1.69 or -1.69
After 1.69 seconds the bungee jumper will touch the river.

IIa)
b) 
c)The axis of symmetry is 0 which is the time the bungee jumper reaches the maximum height
d) the t intercept is also the x intercept or the zero or the root of the quadratic function

 0  = -7t<sup>2</sup> + 0(t) + 20   
 -7t<sup>2</sup> + 0 + 20
 -7t<sup>2</sup> + 20

The h intercept is also the y intercept
f(0) = -7(0)<sup>2</sup> + (0)(0) + 20
-7(0) + 0 + 20
0 + 0 +20
20

The h intercept is the maximum height above the river surface after the bungee jumper leaps from a bridge

Task 2
i) m = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
  5 - 7 / 6 - 5
  -2 / 1
  -2

y -y1 = m(x - x1)
y - 7 = -2(x - 5)
y -7 = -2x + 10
y = -2x + 10 + 7
y = -2x + 17

The equation of the road that connects the two points is -2x + 17

ii) m = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
  5 - 7 / 6 - 5
  -2 / 1
  -2
iii) y -y1 = m(x - x1)
y - 7 = -2(x - 5)
y -7 = -2x + 10
y = -2x + 10 + 7
y = -2x + 17

-2x + 17
mx + b
The changes in road elevation from point A and B is 17

iv) f(x) = -2x + 17
 g(x) = -2x + b
7 = -2(5) + b
7 = -10 + b
-b = -10 -7
-b = -17
b = 17
There is no parallel route for point A(5, 7)

f(x) = -2x + 17
g(x) = (1/ 2)x + b
7 = (1/2) 5 + b
7 = (5 / 2) + b
b = 7 - (5/2)
b = 7 - 2.5
b = 4.5
g(x) = (1/2)x + 4.5

v)

vi) The x intercept is the value of x when the output of the function is zero

f(x) = -2x + 17
0 = -2x + 17
17 = -2x
x = 17 / -2
x = -8.5
The graph crosses the x axis at (-8.5, 0)

The y intercept is the value of the output of the function when the value of x is zero
f(x) = -2x + 17
f(x) = -2(0) + 17
f(x) = 0 + 17
f(x) = 17

The graph crosses the y axis at  (0, 17)
