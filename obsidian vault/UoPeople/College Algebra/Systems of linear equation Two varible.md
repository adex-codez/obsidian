A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations with two or more variables such that all equations in the system are considered simultaneously. 
The solution for a system of linear equation is an ordered pair that satisfies both equations.

Systems of linear equations are categorized by how many solutions they have. The following are categories of linear equations:

A consistent system is a system of linear equations with at least one solution.
A consistent system is an independent system if it has a single solution, the two lines have different slopes and intersects at one point in the plane while a consistent system is dependent if the equations have the same slope and have the same y-intercept.
Another type of system is an inconsistent system if the equation represents two line that  are parallel which means that the equations have the same slope but different y-intercepts.
There no points common to both of the lines so there is no solution to the system


To solve the systems of equations by graphing is done by:

make y the subject of the formula for two of the equations.
then graph the two equation on the same axis.
then use the graph to determine if the system is dependent, independent or incosistent.
