Task 1
i. domain: [-1, 2.7), range: (-∞, ∞)
ii. It is not a function because each value of the x value do not have a single y value

Task 2
ii. E(P) is a function of p. domain: (-∞, 0.7142) U (0.7142, ∞), range: (-∞, 0) U (∞, 0)
v. The independent variable or input value here is p while P is the dependent or output value 


Task 3

i. rate of change = y2-y1 / x2- x1
36 - 1 / 6 - (-1)

35 / 6 + 1

35 / 7  
5

What I  infer from the rate of change is that as the change in the output increases the change in the input also increases.

ii. y2-y1 / x2 - x1
	15 - 4 / 2 -(-4)
	11 / 2 + 4
	11 / 6
	 1.833
what I have seen from their slope is the function is increasing.


Task 4
i. The local extrema is the combination of the local maxima which is where the graph is at the highest and local minima which is were the graph is lowest

iii (-∞, 1]   (increasing) ,   [1,-1]  (decreasing), [-1,1] (increasing),   [1,-1] (decreasing), [-1, 1] (increasing),   [1,-1] (decreasing), [-1,1] (increasing), [1,-1] (decreasing),  [-1, ∞]  (increasing)
