A power function is a function which is expressed in the form
    f(x) = kx<sup>q</sup>, where k = the coefficient and q = the power

To get the end behaviour of a polynomial function the following steps are to be followed
- Check if the power of the polynomial function is even or odd.
- Check if the coefficient polynomial function is a negative or positive
- If the power of the polynomial is even and the coefficient is positive x -> -∞, f(x) -> ∞ and x 
 ->∞, f(x) -> ∞ while if the power of the polynomial is even and the coefficient is negative x -> -∞, f(x) -> -∞ and x -> ∞, f(x) -> -∞, If the power of the polynomial is odd and the coefficient is positive x -> -∞, f(x) -> -∞ and x -> ∞, f(x) -> -∞ while if the power of the polynomial is odd and the coefficient is negative x -> -∞, f(x) -> ∞ and x -> ∞, f(x) -> -∞ 


The general form of the polynomial function goes thus:
f(x) = a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + ... + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + a<sub>1</sup>x + a<sub>0</sub> 

### Degree and the leading coefficient of a polynomial function

The degree of a polynomial function is the highest power of the polynomial function, the leading term is the term which the degree occurs and the leading coefficient is the coefficient of the leading term. 

x<sup>2</sup> + x - 2x - 2
x<sup>2</sup> -x - 2(x -5)

1 - 5(1) + 3 + 6
1- 5 + 3 +6
1 - 5 + 9
