linear function
This is the function for the linear function
f(x) = mx + b, where m = rate of change and b = the first domain.

To find the rate of change(m) do the following
m = y2 -y1 / x2 - x1

y - y1 = m(x - x1)

To find if two lines are parallel their slopes are the same but the y intercept are different while to find if two lines are perpendicular the slope of each line below is the negative reciprocal of the other



### Quadratic Equation

the equation for a quadratic function is ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c

To find the axis of symmetry is x = - (b/2a)

The standard form of a quadratic function is  f(x) = a(x-h)<sup>2</sup> + k
if a > 0, the parabola is opened upward and the vertex is a minimum. if a < 0 is opened downward and the vertex is a maximum.

The vertex of a quadratic function is located at (h, k), where h is the input value and k is the output value.
