an angle is said to be in standard point if the vertex is located at the origin and the initial side extends along the positive x axis.

To convert between a degree and a radian the following formula is used
degree / 180 = radian / π

If two angles in standard position have the same terminal sides they are said to be coterminal, 
every angle greater than 360 and less than 0 are coterminal with angles between 0 and 360.

when an angle is greater than 360, to find the coterminal angle between 0 and 360 do the following:
1. subtract 360 from the angle.
2. if the angle is greater than 360 subtract 360 from it till it is between 0 and 360
3. the resulting angle is the coterminal angle.

when an angle is less than 0, to find the coterminal angle between 0 and 360 do the following:
1. add 360 to the angle.
2. if the angle is still less than 360 add  360 to  it till it is between 0 and 360
3. the resulting angle is coterminal to the original angle.


linear speed = v = s / t, where s = linear displacement or arc length, t = time in secs
angular speed = ω = θ / t where θ = rotations, degrees and radians which is converted to radians if necessary and t = time in secs

the relationship between angular speed and linear speed
v = ωr, where v = linear speed, ω = angular speed which should converted to radians and r = radius
