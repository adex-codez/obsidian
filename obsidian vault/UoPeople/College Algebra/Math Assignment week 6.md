%%  %%Task 1
i. sin(t) = 1/ 2 (the y-axis value is 1 / 2)
   cos(t) = - (sqrt(3) / 2) (the x-axis value is - sqrt(3) / 2)
   tan(t) = 1 / sqrt(3) (sin / cos)
   csc(t) = 2 ( 1 / sin(t))
   sec(t) = 2 / sqrt(3) (1 / cos(t))
   cot = sqrt(3) ( 1 / tan)
ii The second quadrant is where the point line and it so because cosine of angle t is the x-axis which shows that the x-axis  is negative and the second quadrant is where the x-axis is negative.

iii. cos(t) = -(sqrt(3) / 2)
  t  = cos <sup>-1</sup>(-(sqrt(3) / 2))
  t = 5π /6
degrees/180 = radian / π
degreesπ = 180 * radian
degrees = 180 * radian / π
degrees = 180 * (5π /6) / π
degrees = 180 * 5 / 6
degrees = 150
t = 150<sup>∘</sup> 

Task 2
i. for point A the distance from the tree is 40m and the height of the tree is 60m with the given information the formula for finding the angle is
tan(x) = 60 / 40
tan(x) = 3 / 2
x = tan<sup>-1</sup> (3 /2)
x = 56.31 ^ ∘

for point B the distance from the tree is 20m and the height of the tree is 60m with the given information the formula for finding the angle is
tan(x) = 60 / 20
tan(x) = 3 
x = tan<sup>-1</sup> (3)
x = 71.57 ^ ∘

ii the angle of point A is smaller than the angle of B
angle of point A = 56.31 ^ ∘
angle of point B = 71.57 ^ ∘

when you closer to your an object your observing the angle of  elevation is more than when you are closer.

f(θ)             1        1/2      -1/2     -1        -1/2        1 /2       1             1 / 2          - 1 / 2
f(θ) ^ -1     0         60     120        180     240         300         0             60                120


iii. a)  its periodicity is 360.
c)it is even because f(θ) = f(θ) ^ -1
