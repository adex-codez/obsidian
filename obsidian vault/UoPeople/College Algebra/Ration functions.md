To get the horizontal asymptotes you have to check for the following
- if the degree of the denominator and the degree of the numerator are equal you get the ratio of their leading coefficient then the result is the horizontal asymptotes
- if the degree of the denominator is less than the degree of numerator use synthetic division to get the quotient of the numerator then the result is the horizontal asymptotes
- if the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator by one the horizontal asymptote is zero
