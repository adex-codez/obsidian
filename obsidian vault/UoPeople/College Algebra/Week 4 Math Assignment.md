Task 1.
i Turning points: , zeros: -2, -1,  2, x-intercepts: (-2, 0), (-1, 0), (2,0).
iia. The zero -2 has a multiplicity of 1 because the line of the graph passes the x-axis linearly.
b. The zero -1 has a multiplicity of 1 because the line of the graph passes the x-axis linearly.
c. The zero 2 has a multiplicity of 2 because the line of the graph bounces of the x-axis making the multiplicity a even number

iiia. degree: 3.
b. f(x) = a(x+ 2)(x + 1)(x-2)<sup>2</sup>
    -3.123 = a(-1.577+2)(-1.577 + 1)(-1.577 - 2)<sup>2</sup>
    -3.123 = a(0.423)(-0.577)(-3.577)<sup>2</sup>
    -3.123 = a(0.423)(-0.577)(12.795)
    -3.123 = -3.123a
     a = -3.123 / 3.123 
     a = -1
     f(x) = -1(x + 2)(x + 1)(x-2)<sup>2</sup>
iv. 

v. yes we have the local maximum and local minimum which are (-1.577, -3.123) and (0.293, 8.639)

vi. -1(x + 2)(x + 1)(x-2)<sup>2</sup>
(-x - 2)(x + 1)((x - 2)(x - 2))
(-x - 2)(x + 1)(x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 4)
(-x<sup>2</sup> -2x + 2x - 1)(x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 4)
(-x<sup>2</sup> - 1)(x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 4)
(-x<sup>2</sup>)(x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 4) - 1(x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 4)
-x<sup>4</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> +4x + 4
-x<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 4
-x<sup>6</sup> + 4x + 4

Task 2.
i. p / q = the factor of the constant / the factor of the leading term
The constant term is 7 and the factors of 7 are p = 1, 7
The leading term is 1 and the factor of 1 is 1
The possible ration

iii.  x ->  -∞, f(x) -> ∞ and x -> ∞, f(x) -> -∞


Task 3.
i. Vertical Asymptotes
	f(x)=((2 x<sup>2</sup> -5x+3)/(x<sup>2</sup>+5 x))
	    x<sup>2</sup> + 5x = 0
	    x(x+5) = 0
		    x = 0 and x + 5 = 0
			x = 0 and x = -5
	the vertical asymptotes are 0 and -5
 horizontal asymptotes 
  2 /1 = 2
  the horizontal asymptote is 2
ii. x<sup>2</sup> + 5x = 0
	x<sup>2</sup> = -5x
	x<sup>2</sup> / x = -5
	x = -5
The domain of the rational function are real numbers except -5


Task 4.
ia. horizontal asymptotes: , vertical asymptotes: 1, 1, 5.
b) To find the vertical asymptotes find when the denominator is zero then what makes the denominator to be zero is the vertical asymptotes.
To get the horizontal asymptotes you have to check for the following:
- if the degree of the denominator and the degree of the numerator are equal you get the ratio of their leading coefficient then the result is the horizontal asymptotes
- if the degree of the denominator is less than the degree of numerator use synthetic division to get the quotient of the numerator then the result is the horizontal asymptotes
- if the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator by one the horizontal asymptote is zero

ii. 2, 3, 0 

iii.  the x intercepts are 2, 3, 4 and the vertical asymptotes are 1, 1, 5.
f(x) = a (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) / (x - 1)(x -1)(x-5).
-4.8  = a(0-2)(0-3)(0-4) / (0 - 1)(0 - 1)(0 - 5) 
-4.8 = a(-2)(-3)(-4) / (-1)(-1)(-5)
-4.8 = a(-8) / -5
-4.8 * -5 = -8a
24 = -8a
24 / -8 = a
a = -3

f(x) = -3(x - 2)(x -3)(x -4) / (x - 1)(x -1)(x-5)
