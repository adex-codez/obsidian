Consistent: A consistent system is a system of linear equation which has at least one solution.

Inconsistent.
A Inconsistent system in a system of linear equations with two variables two lines are parallel which means the two equations have the same slope but different y-intercept, there is no solution in this system. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)

**Example**
2x+3y​ = 8
4x+6y = 15​ (OpenAI. (2022))


A inconsistent system in a system of linear equation with three variables could exists in three forms which are:
a. all three planes intersect but they don't have a common intersection point.  (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)
b. Two planes intersect with one plane but they never meet which means they are parallel. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)
c. The three planes never intersect which means they are all parallel. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)

**Example**
2x+3y−z = 7
4x+6y−2z = 15
x+2y−3z ​= 5​ (OpenAI. (2022))

Independent.

An independent system in a system of linear equation with two variable two lines have different slopes but intersect at a single point. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)

**Example**
3x−2y = 5
2x+y​ = 4​ (OpenAI. (2022))


An independent system in a system of linear equations three planes intercept at a single point. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)
**Example**
2x−y+z = 7
x+3y−2z = 5
3x+y+z​ = 10​ (OpenAI. (2022))



Dependent.
A dependent system in a system of linear equations with two variable two lines have the same slope and the same y-intercept which the two lines are combined, there are infinite number of solution. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)

**Example**
2x−y
4x−2y​=3=6​ (OpenAI. (2022))

A dependent system in a system of linear equations with three variables three planes intersect in a line which means it has an infinite number of solutions. (Jay Abrahamson, 2021)

**Example**
2x−y+z = 4
4x−2y+2z​ = 8​ (OpenAI. (2022))
