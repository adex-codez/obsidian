-  Recognize the standard normal probability distribution and apply it appropriately.
- Compare normal probabilities by converting to the standard normal distribution.

## The Standard Normal Distribution

The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution of standardized values called the z-scores.
A z-score is measured in units of standard deviation.

z = x - µ / σ which produces 

### Z-scores

if X is a normally distributed random variable and X ~ N(µ,σ), then the z-score is 
z = x - µ / σ

The z-score tells us how many standard deviations the value of x is above(to the right of) or below(to the left of) the mean, µ. Values of x that are larger than the mean have positive z-scores, and values of x that are smaller than the mean have negative z-scores. If x equals the mean, then x has a z-score of zero.

**The Empirical Rule**

-  About 68% of the x values lie between –1σ and +1σ of the mean µ (within one standard deviation of the mean).
-  About 95% of the x values lie between –2σ and +2σ of the mean µ (within two standard deviations of the mean). 
- About 99.7% of the x values lie between –3σ and +3σ of the mean µ (within three standard deviations of the mean). Notice that almost all the x values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.
- The z-scores for +1σ and –1σ are +1 and –1, respectively.
-  The z-scores for +2σ and –2σ are +2 and –2, respectively.
-  The z-scores for +3σ and –3σ are +3 and –3 respectively.
The empirical rule  is also known as 68-95-99.7 rule.


z = x - µ / σ
z * σ = x - µ

z * σ + µ = x
1.27 * 6.28 + 170 = x
177.98
z1 = -1.5
z2 = -1.1
