- The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is met, the block of code that is to be repeated is run once before the condition is checked that means the code to be repeated runs once, the for loop has the initialization, the condition and the incrementation at the head of the for loop.
- The while loop is useful when you don't know how long you want to repeat a block of code or when a condition has to be met for a block of code to be repeated, the do while loop is applicable when you want a block of code to run at least once before a condition is checked, The for loop is applicable when you know the amount of times you want the code to run for example looping over the elements of an array since we know the length of the array we know that we want to loop over all of the elements of an array so the number of times you want your code to be repeated is known.
- while loop
	Advantages
		1. It is best used when the number of times a loop is supposed to run is not known.
	Disadvantages
		2. there is very high potential for infinite loop.
	do while loop:
	 Advantages
			1. It allows the code to be ran once.
	 Disadvantages
			 1. It is difficult to understand because of the code has to run once even if the condition is not met on first try

	for loop
		Advantages
				1. It is easier to understand because it has the  initialization, the condition and the incrementation on one line.
		Disadvantages
				1. When dealing with nested loop it gets a bit complex and confusing

-  The if-else statement is used to check if a condition is met and when the condition is met the statement(s) in the if block is ran but if the condition is not met the statement(s) in the else block is ran while "A switch statement allows you to test the value of an expression and, depending on that value, to jump directly to some location within the switch statement" - (David J. Eck,2022). 
- A real world example where I have found the if else helpful when I want to check if a number is an even number or odd numbers while a real world example for switch statement is when there are defined options that a user can pick from and a particular code is ran according to the option the user has picked.
