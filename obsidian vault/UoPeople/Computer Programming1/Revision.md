The syntax of a programming language is a set of rules that guide what are allowed in the programming language

The semantics of a programming language is the meaning of a programming language

A variable is a name that is given to location in memory.

Expression is anything that refers to or computes data value.

A data type is the type of data that is stored in a variable. Java is strongly typed because the compiler throws an error if you tried to store the data of another data types different from the data type that is supposed to be stored in a variable.

data in java is represented as binary numbers which are a string of zeros and ones.  A single zero and one is a bit, eight bits are called byte.

Constant values are known as literal means does value don't change.

Operators are symbols that are used to represent any type of computation.

Types of Operators

Arithmetic Operators 
This are operators which represent mathematical operations which includes
Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication() and division (/). This operators are used with numerical values and characters.

Increments and Decrements
Increment(++) is an operator that adds one to a value and Decrement(--) is an operator that adds one to a value.

Relational Operators
This are operators that are used to compare values and they are used to form a  boolean expression. they can be used with numerical data types and character data type.

When many operators are used in an expression some operators are executed before some this is refer to as operator precedence.
This are the list of operators with their order of precedence from highest to lowest:
Unary Operators 
Multiplication and Division
Addition and subtraction
Relational Operators
Equality and Inequality
Boolean and
Boolean or
Tenary Operator
Assignment Operators
