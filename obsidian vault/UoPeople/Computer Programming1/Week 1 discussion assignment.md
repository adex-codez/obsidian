1. A variable is a container for storing data while data type are valid types that a variable can contain.
	Since programs manipulate data variables could be used to store the data that could be manipulated and data types guide us on the kind of data that could be stored in a variable.

	The primitive datatypes are the basic datatypes that all other datatypes are derived from for example int, double, float, short, char, long  while a reference datatype is a datatype that is not like the basic datatypes for example classes, interfaces, arrays etc.

	Variables help us to store values so a variable help us to manipulate the values in a variable and datatype specify what type of values that could be stored in a variable each datatype have operations that can be performed on them so datatype could guide us on how to manipulate data, a variable of datatype int can only store integer values without precision so datatype also guide us on where to store our data.

2.  Operator precedence guide us on the order of operations. The operator precedence or in my own words operator  hierarchy affects the evaluation of an expression because operator precedence  is like a rule that guides us on the order of which operation comes first.
	operator precedence helps us in avoiding errors because it guide us on how to arrange operators in an expression so as to avoid error.
