The **Central limit theorem** is one of the most powerful and useful ideals of statistics.
There are two alternative to the theorem and both alternatives are concerned with drawing finite samples size n from a population with a known mean, μ,  and a known standard deviation, σ.
The first alternative says that if we take samples of size n, with a large enough n. Calculate the sample's mean, and create an histogram of those mean, then the resulting histogram will tend to have an approximate normal bell shape.
The second alternative says that if we take a samples of size n with a large enough n. Calculate the sum of each sample, and create an histogram, then the resulting histogram tends to have a normal bell shape.

## The central limit theorem for Sample Means

If you draw random samples of size of n, then as n increases, the random variable X which consists of sample means tends to form a normal distribution and 
X ¯ ~ N (μx, σx/ sqrt(n))
where μx = mean of X and σx = standard deviation of X.\
The central limit theorem for sample means says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples (such as rolling one, two, five and finally, ten dice) and calculating their means, the sample means form their own normal distribution(the sample distribution).
If you draw a random sample size, the distribution of the random  variable X ¯ , which consists of the sample means, is the sample distribution of the mean. 

P(X > 1.8) = 0.
P(X < 2.3) =  0.51692

## The Central Limit Theorem for Sums

The central limit theorem for sums says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples and taking their sums, the sums form their own normal distribution(the sample distribution), which approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The normal distribution has a mean equal to the original mean multiplied by the sample size and a standard deviation equal to the original standard deviation multiplied by the square root of the sample size.

ΣΧ ~ N((n)(μΧ), (sqrt(n))(σΧ))

z = ΣΧ - (n)(μΧ) / (sqrt(n)) (σΧ)
where ΣΧ = one sum,  (n)(μΧ)  = mean of one sum, (sqrt(n)) (σΧ) = standard deviation of one sum.
