1. t is okay to have a theoretical model for a situation in real life because it helps us to understand those real life situations it also helps us to form hypotheses and establish hypotheses as facts.

2. The example of a situation for which a random variable from one of the types that are given in this unit that would serve as a theoretical model is as follows: 
	The times it takes a server to receive a request and send a response back to the client which is making the request is between 30 milliseconds to 300 seconds, X is the time it takes for a  server to receive a request and send a response back to the client.
	
3. The following are the importance to have a theoretical model for a situation in real life
	I. it helps us to analyze those real life situations.
	ii. It also give us better understanding real life situations
	iii. It helps us to look at real life situations from different angles.
