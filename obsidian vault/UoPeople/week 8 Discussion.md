### Questions
**In your own words:**

1. **Define the central limit theorem provide an example from your field of interest.**
2. **Define the Law of large number and provide an example from your field of interest.**
3. **Both the central limit theorem and law of large number rely on the sample being sufficiently large. How large should the sample be? Does it have to be infinite, or a finite sample size is enough?**


### Answers
1. **Central Limit theorem** :  The central limit theorem has two alternatives and they are as follows:
first alternative: If you draw samples size n with large enough n and calculate their mean, then draw an histogram of the mean they tend to form a normal bell curve. 

second alternative: If you draw samples size n with large enough n and calculate the sum of each sample, and create an histogram , the histogram tends to form a normal bell curve. 

2. **Law of large number** : it states that as the number of repition of an experiment is increased the relative frequency obtained in an experiment tends to become closer and
closer to the theoretical probability.

3. The sample size doesn't have to be infinite, if it is finite but large enough.
