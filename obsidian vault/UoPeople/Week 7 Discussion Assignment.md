## Questions
**Based on what you have studied in this unit, reflect and answer the following questions:**

- **What are the main characteristics of the normal distribution?**
- **Why is it advantageous to use the Z scores?**

**For a standard normal distribution, about 68% of values falls within one standard deviation of the mean; about 95% falls within two standard deviations; and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. Suppose the distribution of math scores in the SAT follow a normal distribution with a mean µ=700 and a standard deviation σ=150.**

1. **Calculate the Z-score for an SAT Math score of 600. Interpret it in your own word.**
2. **Find the interval [a, b] that captures 68% of the SAT Math score in this example.**
3. **Find the interval [a, b] that captures 95% of the SAT Math score in this example.**
4. **Find the interval [a, b] that captures 99.7% of the SAT Math score in this example.**

## Answers
1a.  The median, mean and mode are equal.
b. The curve is symmetric at the center, which is around the mean.
c. The total area under the curve is 1.
d. Exactly 1/2 of all the values are known to be to the left of center whereas exactly half of all the values are to the right of the center.
(What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?, n.d.)

2. It is advantageous to use the z-score because it allows us to compare data that are scaled differently.

3a. To use get the z-score of a value x the following formula is used
z = x - µ / σ

where x = 600, µ = mean = 700, σ = standard deviation = 150

z = 600 -700 / 150
z = -100 / 150
z = -0.67
This interprets as that x = 600, is -0.67 standard deviations to the left of the mean, 700.


b. Since 68% of the x values lie between -1σ = -1(150) = -150 and 1σ = 1(150) = 150, therefore 68% of x value  lie between 600 -  150 = 450 and 600 + 150 = 750, which means 68% of x values lie between 450 and 750.

c. Since 95% of the x values lie between -2σ = -2(150) = -300 and 2σ = 1(150) = 300, therefore 68% of x value  lie between 600 -  300 = 300 and 600 + 300 = 900, which means 95% of x values lie between 300 and 900.

d. Since 99.7% of the x values lie between -3σ = -3(150) = -450 and 3σ = 3(150) = 450, therefore 68% of x value  lie between 600 -  450 = 150 and 600 + 450 = 1050, which means 99.7% of x values lie between 150 and 1050.
