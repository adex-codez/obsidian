The following are functional programming techniques:

## Composition 

functional composition is a technique that allows us to combine multiple functions to create a more complex function.

Rules for composition
- The functions in composition can only be unary functions
- The first function's argument type should be the same as the last function in the composition's return type. eg. even if the functions that are composed are much they must honor this rule.
The following help us to combine functions:
### Partial Application

This is a functional programming technique that allow us to pass the arguments of a function at any different points in time.
A function which implements partial application can also implement complete application. that is to say that a function which implements partial application which means the arguments of the function can be given at a different points in time can also pass the arguments at once which means the function can also implement complete application.

### Currying

Currying is a functional programming technique that allows us to apply a function partially without having to worry about the way in which we implement our function.
This is the process of taking a function takes many arguments and transforms it to a chain of unary functions.

### Pipes

This is a function or operator that allows us to pass the output of a function as the input of another function. 

The following are other functional programming techniques:

## Point-Free Style

Point-free programming or tacit programming is a type of programming style in which function declaration do not declare their arguments of points on which they operate.


## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching allows you to match a value(or an object) against some patterns to select a branch of the code.
